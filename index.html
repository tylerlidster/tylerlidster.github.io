        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p>I am a 25 year old designer living in Los Angeles. Up until 10 months ago I had spent my entire life in the Chicago area. A few months prior to my move I started at Full Sail University to better myself as a designer and to continue the intellectual pursuit of academics. It has almost been one year since starting my degree in Web Design and Development. I prefer the design more than the development, though I do enjoy them both. Designing allows me a chance to escape, to create, and a sense of accomplishment that comes with making something that did not previously exist. In any extra time I give extra attention and focus to UX and UI design to better understand them for they intrigue me greatly. </p>

        <h4><a href="http://tylerlidster.github.io/header-diesel/index.html">Diesel.com | Header</a></h4>
        <img src="images/diesel-header.jpg" alt="Diesel.com | Header">
        <p>Diesel.com is targeting fashionable young adults that like to think differently, people who set themselves apart from others by breaking uniformity.  The main goal for a clothing company is to sell clothes. This is clear first and foremost upon entering the site. Right in front of you stares an image that takes up the full width and near almost full height of the screen. The navigation at the top is clear and stands its own amongst the full screen image. The distinction between navigation and the image is significant because of the way it draws you in. Its very clean and has a dominance that gives it a very modern feel.  The text, font, and spacing all seem to align with the company’s vision. </p>
        <h4><a href="http://tylerlidster.github.io/header/index.html">Virginamerica.com | Header</a></h4>
        <img src="images/virgin-header.jpg" alt="Diesel.com | Header">
        <p>Virginamerica.com is an incredible website. Everything is clean, modern and exceptionally good at drawing your eye to the right places. The header is well organized, clear and has a very welcoming vibe. The font and color scheme align with a vacation type vibe and work really well throughout the design. The content is clearly labeled and there is clear hierarchy. With a web site as tech savvy and modern as this one I think Virginamerica.com is targeting young adults who are familiar with technology and have a bit of independence in their personality. </p>
        <h4><a href="http://tylerlidster.github.io/contact us/index.html">Diesel.com | Contact Us</a></h4>
        <img src="images/diesel-contact.jpg" alt="Diesel.com | Contact Us">
        <p>Diesel.com is efficient in their contact form here and that is why I like it more than almost any others I came across while doing my research. It’s simple and clear. Nothing in the form is more dominant than any other, which helps guide the user easily down the screen. This is an excellent example of functional design.</p>
        <h4>Diesel.com | Registration</h4>
        <img src="images/diesel-registration.jpg" alt="Diesel.com | Registration">
        <p>Diesel.com made a really great registration form here. It’s subtle in the way that it vaguely distorts the background to draw your attention to the form in the foreground. I especially like that this takes up the entire screen because of what this form actually is (a sign up form). It forces the user to decide to I want to sign up in these very few short steps or do I want to close out with almost just as much effort. Forcing the user to make a quick decision but really making it super simple for the user to take either option.  The color and hierarchy are great and work really well with the design. The same goes for the font and spacing of everything within the screen. </p>
        <h4><a href="http://tylerlidster.github.io/registration/index.html">Express.com | Registration</a></h4>
        <img src="images/express-registration.jpg" alt="Express.com | Registration">
        <p>Express.com created a good, clean and simple registration page. The return and create sections are clearly labeled for the user to easily decide which step they need to take. The dominance is in the submit buttons which again helps to guide the user to the important parts of the page. The layout is crisp and modern. A good use of a subtle color scheme as well.</p>
        <h4>Virginamerica.com | Registration</h4>
        <img src="images/virgin-registration.jpg" alt="Virginamerica.com | Registration">
        <p>Virginamerica.com created an excellent registration page that is very minimal. The page has almost no imagery that distracts the user from the task. The slight bit of color that is used works really well and aligns with the rest of the company's design. The input fields are clearly labeled.</p>
        <h4><a href="http://tylerlidster.github.io/login/index.html">Virginamerica.com | Login</a></h4>
        <img src="images/virgin-login.jpg" alt="Virginamerica.com | Login">
        <p>Virginamerica.com login page is the best I have seen. It takes up the whole page, forcing the user to focus on the important information in front of them without much distraction. The vibrancy of the red and white work really well together and capture the users attention. The screen is clearly divided into thirds. The first third is only text with the please login message. The second third are the actual input fields. The final third is what sets this apart from other login forms. It's a simple design for links to additional information but the way its presented really helps to gain interest into what they are. These are links most users would normally overlook but in this case it makes me want to explore them. </p>
        <h4>Virginamerica.com | Forms</h4>
        <img src="images/virgin-forms.jpg" alt="Virginamerica.com | Forms">
        <p>The virginamerica.com form is great for many reasons. The styling is excellent. The hints that help the user to complete their tasks are all great and do exactly what they should and well. The submit button is clear and vibrant, clearly dominating the screen to guide the user. There is a clear hierarchy and distinction between the sections. The design is modern, clear and simple.</p>
        <h4>Virginamerica.com | Calendar</h4>
        <img src="images/virgin-calendar.jpg" alt="Virginamerica.com | Calendar">
        <p>The virginamerica.com calendar is perfect in my opinion. It takes up the whole screen and really helps guide the users eye to the correct date they are looking for. The calendar lacks much color but it makes up for that in it's simplicity, ease of use, and productivity. It seems like virginamerica.com really simplified their site to enable users to focus on one task at a time and ensure that each user can complete that task quickly and efficiently.</p>
        <h4>Virginamerica.com | Error</h4>
        <img src="images/virgin-error.jpg" alt="Virginamerica.com | Error">
        <p>Virginamerica.com error message is dominating on the eye. It really captures your eye when it pops up on the screen which is extremely helpful because its main purpose is to alert the user to the issue. They used for this error and that is a great choice because it is vibrant and alerting in nature.</p>
        <h4>Virginamerica.com | About</h4>
        <img src="images/virgin-about.jpg" alt="Virginamerica.com | About">
        <p>I included virginamerica.com's about section because I really like the way it is laid out, it's very pleasing on the eyes. It's also very efficient in presenting the information it needs to in a straightforward visually appealing manner. The distinction made by the lack of color in the text and background and the dominance of color if the photos is very well used and comes across quite well.</p>
        <h4><a href="http://tylerlidster.github.io/footer/index.html">Diesel.com | Footer</a></h4>
        <img src="images/diesel-footer.jpg" alt="Diesel.com | Footer">
        <p>The Diesel.com footer is exactly what it should and needs to be. The links are simple and clear. There is no real distraction within the entirety of the footer, which helps present the user with all choices equally. What really drew me to this footer was how the set up their share links. The icon and text combination works really well and the lack of color is perfect because of the varying odd colors the many different social networks use. The footer design aligns well with the rest of the website.</p>
